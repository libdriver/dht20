## LibDriver DHT20

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/dht20/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

DHT20 is a new upgraded product of DHT11, equipped with a dedicated ASIC sensor chip, a high-performance semiconductor silicon-based capacitive humidity sensor and a standard onchip temperature sensor, and uses a standard I2C data output signal format. Its performance has been greatly improved and has exceeded the reliability level of the previous generation sensor.The new generation of upgraded products have been improved to make their performance more stable in high temperature and high humidity environments; at the same time, the accuracy, response time, and measurement range of the product have been greatly improved.Each sensor is rigorously calibrated and tested before leaving the factory to ensure and satisfy customer’s large-scale applications. It can be used in HVAC, dehumidifier, testing and inspection equipment, consumer products, automobiles, automatic control, data loggers, weather stations, home appliances, humidity control, medical and other application fields which need to detect and control temperature and humidity.

LibDriver DHT20 is a full-featured driver of DHT20 launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of reading temperature and relative humidity. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver DHT20 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver DHT20 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver DHT20 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver DHT20 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver DHT20 offline document.

/datasheet includes DHT20 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_dht20_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float temperature;
uint8_t humidity;

res = dht20_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    dht20_interface_delay_ms(2000);
    res = dht20_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (uint8_t *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)dht20_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    dht20_interface_debug_print("dht20: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    dht20_interface_debug_print("dht20: humidity is %d%%.\n", humidity); 
    
    ...
        
}

...

(void)dht20_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
